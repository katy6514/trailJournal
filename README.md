# Digitizing my trail journal of my Continental Divide Trail Thruhike

During the summer of 2024 I spent 6 months hiking from the Canadian border down the spine of the Rockies towards the Mexican border following the CDT through Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.

I used a Garmin InReach to record my campsite locations, and send messages to loved ones. I also kept a journal, recorded videos daily and took TONS of pictures.

This project is my attempt to put all this data into one visualization of my summer adventure using D3.js
